## My Repository
In this GitHub repository, you will find my completed assignment for week 5 of the programme. My task was to create an interactive timed coding quiz with multiple choice questions with a clean, polished and responsive user interface. I believe I was successful in meeting the vast majority of the criteria set, though I didn't quite complete the highscore page.

## Installation

Nothing is required to install my project, but the project is deployed live at this URL: https://ben-pauley.github.io/assignment-4/.

## Software Used

This project was completed using Visual Studio Code and I tested the website using Google Chrome. The assignment was largely completed using JavaScript functions

## Conclusion

I really enjoyed the challenge of this assignment and learned so much along the way. I am disappointed that I couldn't complete it in its entirety, but I am immensely proud of what I did achieve.
